One supporting fact to this claim is that when we listen to audio books or podcasts, we are never 100% tuned in. We aren’t really listening to it with a strong intention to understand. We are just letting it hit our subconscious. This is why, when you truly want to understand what is being discussed or said, you have to stop everything, rewind and listen a few times.
