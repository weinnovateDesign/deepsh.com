				<p>
					It is time to talk about Software as a Service (Saas). Product
					research, strategy, design, development and everything Saas. Along
					with occasional rant on tech trends and culture.
				</p>

				<p>
					I work at a B2B tech startup company called BigDataCloud, based in
					Adelaide, South Australia.
				</p>

				<p>
					I started my first Saas company in 2008 in Bangalore, India called
					Simplify360. Currently, it is one of the leading customer experience
					engagement and analytics company in India. In 2018, I moved to
					Australia and started an independent Saas consulting firm.
				</p>

				<p>
					I am originally from Nepal and have a degree in Bachelors in
					Electronics and Communication Engineering.
